# Health-Management-System
This Health Management System(HMS) helps to keep track of a person's Diet and Exercise by maintaining a Log . This  allows a person to write or read the data into the HMS . Basically I have used File Handling Techniques to keep the data and a Time Stamp for easy understanding the data in the system.
It's a simple program using python and designed to provide a basic interface to the HMS.
It is a beginner practice exercise to understand the Functions and it's Behaviours while using a File Handling operation.
